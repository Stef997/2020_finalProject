To read the line and move on, we should use the nextLine() method. This method advances the scanner past the current line and returns the input that wasn't reached initially. This method returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line separator at the end of the line. The read position is then set to the beginning of the next line, which will be read and returned upon calling the method again.
